# Changelog

All notable changes to hippo are recorded here. Format is loosely
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)-shaped, kept plain — DOC-7
(tags, version-sync CI, formal release process) will formalize this later;
until then entries are written by hand alongside each release.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-07-07 — "The graph earns its keep: typed relations and closed lifecycle loops"

### Format changes

This release introduces corpus format versioning (COR-7) and bumps it once:

- **Corpus format 1 → 2** (GRA-4) — additive: `supersedes:` / `contradicts:` /
  `refines:` typed relations may now appear in frontmatter alongside untyped
  `[[wikilinks]]`. Existing corpora keep working unchanged; `/hippo:doctor`
  reports the corpus's stamped format vs. what the plugin expects and names
  the exact next step (stamp the marker, no autonomous migration).
- **Index schema 2 → 3** (RET-5) — adds a `source_commit_time` field to each
  manifest entry. COR-7's enforcement means a schema mismatch now costs
  exactly one full rebuild instead of silently serving a stale shape; nothing
  the operator needs to do by hand.

New env vars: `HIPPO_DUP_THRESHOLD` (LIF-2 near-duplicate cosine/BM25
threshold override) and `HIPPO_SALIENCE` (RET-5 salience-fusion ranking
blend — **default off**; the eval numbers on this release's fixtures showed
zero regression but also zero measurable lift, so it ships opt-in rather than
on-by-default until a corpus with real usage/staleness signal can prove it).

### Shipped this release

- **COR-7** — enforces index schema versioning and adds corpus format
  versioning, with a doctor-driven migration surface for both.
- **GRA-4** — typed edges (`supersedes` / `contradicts` / `refines`): recall
  demotes and annotates superseded memories pre-cut, flags contradictions,
  and `lint_links` catches dangling typed targets.
- **GRA-5** — `archive_memory` refuses (without `--force`) when inbound
  links — untyped or typed — still point at the target, and reports the
  referrer list either way.
- **GRA-9** — the reconsolidation worklist grows a report-only 1-hop
  "linked" column so a stale memory's neighbors surface for review too.
- **LIF-1** — demote gets a terminal state: it now chains straight into
  soft-invalidation (no second manual command), and a snooze/ack primitive
  stops re-nagged items from re-appearing every session.
- **LIF-2** — write-time near-duplicate/conflict detection (warn-only):
  `write_memory` surfaces nearest-neighbor matches and the `/hippo:new`
  skill routes the add / update-existing / supersede / skip decision.
- **LIF-3** — citation rot (a renamed/deleted cited file silently dropping
  out of `cited_paths`) is now surfaced instead of vanishing unnoticed.
- **LIF-4** — usage aggregates now survive telemetry-ledger rotation, and
  `archive_candidates` finally enforces its own ≥5-session soak gate.
- **LIF-5** — a missing/renamed `MEMORY.md` floor section is repaired or
  loudly reported — never a silent no-op.
- **LIF-6** — staleness and reconsolidation SessionStart producers share one
  computed stale set, so no memory is reported twice.
- **RET-5** — salience fusion (recency/usage/staleness ranking priors),
  shipped behind `HIPPO_SALIENCE` (default off) per this release's honest
  eval numbers.
- **RET-6** — drifted injections carry a one-line verify-at-use banner;
  reverifying a memory clears it on the next SessionStart.
- **TEA-4** — floor pointers insert at a deterministic sorted position
  instead of always appending at the section tail, so concurrent teammate
  writes to the same floor section merge cleanly instead of colliding.
- **QUA-8** — the skills-contract suite now extracts and checks every fenced
  code block in every `SKILL.md` for real (compiles, resolves every
  `memory.*` reference and call signature against the live package).
- **QUA-10** — `pytest.ini` hardening: `slow` marker, `filterwarnings =
  error` with targeted ignores, a timeout default, and the suite's one
  permanent skip repointed at the shipped operator-pack assets (now a real
  packaging gate — the suite ends at 0 skipped).
- **DOC-6** — `CONVENTIONS.md` seeded into every corpus by `/hippo:init`,
  documenting the frontmatter schema, type taxonomy, floor rule, typed
  relations, and evidence-block convention as actually shipped.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-07-06 — "Recall precision: earn every injected token, in every language"

### Breaking

Every `MEMOBOT_*` environment variable is renamed to `HIPPO_*` (suffix
unchanged). This is a **clean break** — per the one-canonical-name invariant
there are NO alias shims and NO fallback reads of the old prefix. Any
`MEMOBOT_*` var still set in a shell profile, CI secret, or `.env` file is now
silently ignored by every module; `/hippo:doctor` gained a check that warns
(by name) when a stale `MEMOBOT_*` var is present in the environment, but it
will not repair anything for you — rename it yourself.

Rename table (old -> new, suffix identical in every case):

| Old (removed)                    | New (canonical)                |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `MEMOBOT_DISABLE_DENSE`           | `HIPPO_DISABLE_DENSE`           |
| `MEMOBOT_TRUST_ALL`               | `HIPPO_TRUST_ALL`               |
| `MEMOBOT_TELEMETRY_DIR`           | `HIPPO_TELEMETRY_DIR`           |
| `MEMOBOT_MEMORY_DIR`              | `HIPPO_MEMORY_DIR`              |
| `MEMOBOT_TRUST_FILE`              | `HIPPO_TRUST_FILE`              |
| `MEMOBOT_TELEMETRY_MAX_BYTES`     | `HIPPO_TELEMETRY_MAX_BYTES`     |
| `MEMOBOT_INDEX_DIR`               | `HIPPO_INDEX_DIR`               |
| `MEMOBOT_EMBED_MODEL`             | `HIPPO_EMBED_MODEL`             |
| `MEMOBOT_RECENT_DAYS`             | `HIPPO_RECENT_DAYS`             |
| `MEMOBOT_DENSE_TIMEOUT`           | `HIPPO_DENSE_TIMEOUT`           |
| `MEMOBOT_REFRESH_TIMEOUT`         | `HIPPO_REFRESH_TIMEOUT`         |
| `MEMOBOT_EMBED_CHUNK_SIZE`        | `HIPPO_EMBED_CHUNK_SIZE`        |
| `MEMOBOT_GRAPH_SEEDS`             | `HIPPO_GRAPH_SEEDS`             |
| `MEMOBOT_BODY_RRF_WEIGHT`         | `HIPPO_BODY_RRF_WEIGHT`         |
| `MEMOBOT_DENSE_FLOOR`             | `HIPPO_DENSE_FLOOR`             |
| `MEMOBOT_KNEE_RATIO`              | `HIPPO_KNEE_RATIO`              |

Unrelated vars are untouched: `FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH`, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`,
`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and every `CLAUDE_*` var belong to
other systems and keep their names. `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json`
version numbers are intentionally NOT bumped in this release — that sync is
DOC-7's job (v0.6.0).

### Shipped this release

- **RET-1** — relevance floor + knee cutoff, so a low-signal query surfaces
  nothing rather than padding out to a fixed count.
- **RET-2** — body-aware indexing; recall is no longer capped at the
  `description:` field's discipline.
- **RET-3** — Unicode-aware tokenization plus an opt-in `--multilingual`
  bootstrap preset for non-English corpora.
- **RET-4** — mines fence/traceback identifiers instead of stripping them.
- **RET-7** — records the serving backend and audits the eval-set generation
  phase.
- **GRA-1** — 1-hop neighbor expansion in recall: the graph's first
  load-bearing ranking read.
- **GRA-2** — stem-normalized `LinkGraph` identity plus `inbound()` /
  `isolates()` backlink primitives.
- **GRA-3** — bootstraps the link graph at write time.
- **GRA-6** — persists the resolved edge list in the index (`links.json`).
- **PRF-1** — persists BM25 statistics; stops rebuilding the scorer per query.
- **PRF-2** — promotes `cold_latency` from report-only to a gated check.
- **COR-8** — emits true fused scores and cross-checks index vs. query
  embedding model.
- **COR-9** — makes soft-alias collisions ambiguous instead of
  first-claimant-wins.
- **QUA-6** — pins gate constants and adds a golden-corpus dense benchmark.
- **QUA-7** — adds subprocess tests for the `bin/hippo` launcher.
- **DOC-8** — this rename, plus a doctor check for stale `MEMOBOT_*` vars.
